# PATH PLANNING PROJECT

<p>In this project I was working on multi-agent path planning with collision avoidance.</p>
<p>First off I started learning about different algorithms such as: A*, Djisktra, BFS, ILP, CBS and their different variants.</p>
<p>There are a few visualizations in this project, for 2D it only calculates single agent path using A* and visualizes it in pygame. As for 3D visualization I am trying to implement CBS in Blender.</p>

# How to use

## 2D pygame

<p>To visualize agent path planning in 2D, you need to run AStar/heapAStarVisual.py or AStar/SingleAStarVisual.py</p>
<p>First left mouse click defines starting location (green), second defines goal location (red), other times clicking will draw obstacles(grey). Right mouse click is for reseting squares (to white).</p>

## 3D Blender
